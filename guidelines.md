# Blog Post Guidelines

1. Don't Be A Dick.
2. Be professional; fun is still okay.
3. Represent facts realistically and without marketing speak. 
  - Instead of: "The speedup is of PHPNG is very impressive; Wordpress got a 20% speedup!" 
    It would be better to say: "PHPNG generally improves runtime performance; Wordpress saw a 20% speedup with an early version of the branch."
4. Tripple check *everything*. (speling too)
5. Keep explanations as simple as possible, no simpler.
6. Topics for the blog are limited to projects on git.php.net.
