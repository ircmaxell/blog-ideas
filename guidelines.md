# Qualification Criteria

Any member of php.net may write about any work being carried out on any PHP.net projects

# Guidelines

1. Use common sense.
2. Be professional; fun is still okay.
3. Do not provide generic opinions.
  - This means no campaigning, either for or against a proposal, via a post.
  - Posts should be about what *is* happening, not what you think *should* happen.
4. Represent facts realistically and without marketing speak. 
  - Instead of: "The speedup is of PHPNG is very impressive; Wordpress got a 20% speedup!" 
    It would be better to say: "PHPNG generally improves runtime performance (link to statistics); Wordpress saw a 20% speedup with an early version of the branch."
5. Tripple check *everything*. (speling too)
6. Keep explanations as simple as possible, no simpler.

# Publication Procedure

Before a post is published, an editor must confirm that the content complies with these criteria and guidelines.

Any member may assume the role of editor for any other members posts, published posts will display the name of the author *and* editor in public.

**If these guidelines are followed, no member of php.net shall interfere with any content posted by another member of php.net.**

# Public Discourse

If a member disagrees with the content of an article, the proper thing to do is engage in discourse; the member who disagrees should write their own blog post *following the proper procedure*, attempting to prove the other party wrong *in a civilized way*, using facts and reasoning.

# Exceptional Circumstances

In the exceptional circumstance that a substaintial portion of the group feels a post should be removed from the blog, a *reasonable* discussion inclusive of the author and or editor of the post *must* take place in the public sphere to find an acceptable solution.

# Ethos

By willingly engaging in public discourse we create for ourselves a healthy atmosphere in which to communicate, and simultaneously debate, the development of PHP in a completely transparent way.
