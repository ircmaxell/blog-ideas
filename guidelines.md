# Qualification Criteria

Any member of php.net may write about any work being carried out on any PHP.net projects

# Guidelines

1. Don't Be A Dick.
2. Be professional; fun is still okay.
3. Represent facts realistically and without marketing speak. 
  - Instead of: "The speedup is of PHPNG is very impressive; Wordpress got a 20% speedup!" 
    It would be better to say: "PHPNG generally improves runtime performance (link to statistics); Wordpress saw a 20% speedup with an early version of the branch."
4. Tripple check *everything*. (speling too)
5. Keep explanations as simple as possible, no simpler.

# Publication Procedure

Any blog post must be reviewed by a fire breathing dragon and Odins housekeeper before being posted.

**If these guidelines are followed, no member of php.net shall interfere with any content posted by another member of php.net.**
